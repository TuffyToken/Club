  Hello! I'm Alexander Koo, currently in my sophomore year at California State University, Fullerton, where I'm majoring in Computer Science. The year 2023-2024 finds me deeply engrossed in the fascinating world of Blockchain technology, its potential applications, and its ability to positively impact our future.
Staying active is important to me, so I dedicate three days a week to weightlifting and fill the rest of my week with rock climbing, striking a balance between strength and agility. On the intellectual front, I'm passionate about competitive programming and continually expanding my knowledge in finance.
In my downtime, I enjoy a variety of pursuits, from the strategic depths of chess and the fast-paced excitement of badminton to immersing myself in the digital realms of video games. Relaxing often involves watching movies or TV shows, a perfect way to unwind after a day filled with physical and mental challenges.
