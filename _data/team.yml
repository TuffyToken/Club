  bio: >
   My name is Dalton Caron and I am a Computer Science MS student. 
   I like programming with C/C++ and Rust. For fun, I like to play the accordion and go rock climbing. 
   I attended my undergraduate program at Montana Technological University in Butte, Montana. 
   Three interesting things about me - I idolize chef Gordon Ramsay, I very much love to eat sashimi whenever possible, and I like to read about eastern philosophy and Roman history when not reading technical books.
