    Rare aggressive extra-nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unresponsive to standard treatments
    and has a poor prognosis. My projects aim to genetically characterize these extra-nodal lymphomas to better understand
    potential mechanisms driving their pathologies. One project involves investigating primary extranodal DLBCLs (specifically
    primary DLBCL in the testes and CNS), and understanding biological distinctions that separate these extranodal DLBCLs
    compared to their nodal counterparts, and to examine factors that promote their progression. The other project involves
    examining plasmablastic lymphoma, a disease typically involving immunocompromised individuals. Because of the rarity of this
    disease, very few studies have been able to examine the genomic landscape of this disease in depth. Coming from an epigenetics
    background, I have a particular interest in understanding the dynamics between the genome and epigenome in cancer.

    I perform various computational analyses to assist in the classification of driver genes within Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
    By using computational methods designed to recognize recurrently mutated elements, it is possible to identify mutational
    hotspots within genes of interest. Hotspots, or genomic regions that contain a higher density of mutations than would be
    expected, can be recognized by analyzing the linear genomic sequence or the 3D structure of the expressed protein.
    3D structure-based methods can supplement driver gene discovery by identifying regions in the tertiary structure that
    may mediate protein function and cell survival. I employ both types of methods for hotspot identification and driver
    gene discovery.

    My research project focuses on identifying mutations in patients with relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma; specifically,
    the analysis of liquid biopsies obtained from these patients. As cells undergo apoptosis, apoptotic bodies containing DNA
    are released into the bloodstream, and this DNA is called cell-free DNA. In patients with cancer, a portion of this
    cell-free DNA originates from malignant cells, termed circulating-tumour DNA. Thus, we can obtain tumour genetic material
    simply by obtaining a blood sample (called a liquid biopsy), which is less invasive and significantly cheaper than traditional
    biopsies. Due to the unique nature of liquid biopsies, I am currently developing several pieces of software for analyzing
    and benchmarking existing mutation-calling tools for use with these types of samples. I am applying these tools to samples
    collected from several clinical trials where liquid biopsies are collected after patients are treated. By comparing the
    mutation landscape of these patients prior to and following treatment, we identify mutations enriched following treatment,
    which may contribute to tumour treatment resistance.

    I earned my PhD in Evolutionary Biology from Germany. Before joining the Morin lab in January 2021, I was a postdoc
    at university of California-Davis and UBC-University of Calgary working on understanding the genomic bases of adaptation
    and convergent evolution. Cancers evolve by a reiterative process of clonal expansion, genetic diversification and
    clonal selection within the adaptive landscapes of tissue ecosystems. The dynamics are complex, with highly variable
    patterns of genetic diversity and resulting clonal architecture which are closely related to cancer progression, resistance
    to therapy, and recurrences,therefore, our better understanding of the evolutionary landscape in cancer can help to develop
    advanced treatments matching appropriately selected molecular targets. My main interest is to apply evolutionary genomics
    tools to understand intra-tumour heterogeneity across multiple non-Hodgkin Lymphomas and to reconstruct their evolutionary
    history as part of the Pan-cancer analysis of B-cell lymphomas using whole-genome sequencing data. These analyses will
    eventually allow us to reveal the timing of specific genomic aberrations and changing mutational process over the course
    of cancer evolution.
